# Hi, I'm Rajat Golechha 👋

### Software Engineer • Quant Developer  
🎓 B.Tech, Computer Science & Engineering — **IIT Delhi**  
💼 Quant Analyst/Engineer at **Alphagrep Securities**, Bangalore  
📍 Interested in **high-performance systems, distributed infrastructure, C++ engineering, and quant development**

---

## 🚀 About Me
I enjoy building **low-level systems**, understanding how they work internally, and writing software that is fast, reliable, and efficient.

At Alphagrep, I work on:
- Improving strategy performance through modeling and data analysis  
- Building and optimizing research/backtesting pipelines  
- Writing efficient C++/Python code for production and experiments  

I’m especially drawn to problems in systems, performance, algorithms, and parallelism — anything that requires careful reasoning and solid engineering. I like projects where the design choices actually matter.
