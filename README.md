## 🚀 About Me
I enjoy building **low-level systems**, understanding **how things work under the hood**, and designing software that is **fast, correct, and scalable**.

At Alphagrep, I work as a **Quant Analyst/Engineer**, focusing on:
- Improving strategy performance through modeling & data analysis  
- Building and optimizing research pipelines  
- Writing efficient C++/Python code for backtesting & production  

I like challenging problems in systems, performance, parallelism, and algorithms — the kind that force deep thinking and careful engineering.
